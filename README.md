## __1. Overview:__
   
   This project focuses on using Artificial Neural Networks (ANN) to optimize energy consumption in smart buildings. By leveraging historical energy usage data, the model predicts future consumption patterns, helping to improve energy efficiency and reduce costs.
   The study aims to:

   Develop an ANN-based predictive model for energy consumption forecasting.

   Evaluate model performance using metrics like MSE, MAE, RMSE, R² score, and Accuracy.

   Provide insights that can assist in HVAC optimization and anomaly detection.

## __2. Implemented Algorithm: Artificial Neural Networks (ANN):__

   Artificial Neural Networks (ANN) are powerful for capturing complex relationships between energy consumption and influencing factors such as occupancy, weather conditions, and time-based patterns.

   ### Model Architecture:

   Input Layer: Features such as temperature, time of day, and occupancy.

   Hidden Layers: Uses ReLU activation to model non-linear energy patterns.

   Output Layer: Predicts the building’s energy consumption.

## __3. Dataset Used:__
   
   The dataset consists of 3,840 records of energy consumption data, including:

   Time-based variables (hour, day, season).

   Environmental factors (temperature, humidity).

   Building-specific data (occupancy, HVAC usage).
